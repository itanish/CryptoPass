# CryptoPass
 CryptoPass is a decentralized option to logging into different websites by eliminating use of passwords, that is the traditional method currently used for authentication.

 So the user doesn't have to remember any password and can login with just a click of button, the rest will be taken care of by CryptoPass. 

 FacebookDemo in our Repo is a demo login website which contains the option to login# through CryptoPass just like you have options to login with Google or Facebook but now in a decentralized way. 
  If the user hasn't registered earlier with CryptoPass, he will be redirected to the register page of CryptoPass.
 
  If the user is registered with CryptoPass he will be validated using his public key, private key (provided by MetaMask) and username that will be done in backend, so all that the user has to do is just click Login with CryptoPass and he's/she's in.
  
 CryptoPass is a website which registers the user with a unique username. It uses smart contracts to validate the user in Backend using keys provided by MetaMask.
